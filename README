i18nScanner 1.0
  i18nScanner is a simple utility used to scan for missing i18n calls within Mojo applications.

Execution:
  i18nScanner is designed to be run in the Rhino shell environment. Other engines may work provided they
  allow access to Java objects and provide the print and readFile APIs but are not officially supported.

  A convenience script, i18nscanner.sh has been provided for sh environments.
    i18nScanner.sh resourceFile1 resourceFile2 ...

  Other environments should execute the following javascript files:
    - jsParser/jsParserLogger.js
    - jsParser/rhinoLogger.js
    - jsParser/jsLineBuffer.js
    - jsParser/jsParser.js
    - jsParser/jsLex.js
    - i18nScannerJS.js
    - i18nScannerXHTML.js
    - mojoIgnores.js
    - i18nScanner.js

      -- or --
    Export the path to the extracted Rhino libraries in the RHINO_DIR environment variable.
